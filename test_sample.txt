This is a test file to demonstrate the git-deploy-schedule functionality.

When this file is modified, the scheduler will:
1. Detect the change
2. Stage the file
3. Send the diff to Ollama
4. Generate a contextual commit message
5. Create the commit
6. Optionally push to remote (if enabled)

Modify this file to test the system.
